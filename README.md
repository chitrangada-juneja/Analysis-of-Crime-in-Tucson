# Analysis-of-Crime-in-Tucson

This project analyzes the factors influencing crime in Tucson using publicly available open-source data. Our aim was to model and predict crime trends by examining the relationship between crime rates and four key variables: Income, Education, Unemployment, and Distance from Downtown.

We sourced data primarily from the City of Tucsonâ€™s Open Data Portal, along with supporting research papers, reports, and crime statistics. Using data-driven methods and machine learning models, we explored how these factors correlate with crime over time.

Beyond analysis, we also discuss the ethical implications of predictive policing and what such models could mean for the people of Tucson.
